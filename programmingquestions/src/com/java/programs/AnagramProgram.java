/**
 * Two strings are called anagrams if they contain same set of characters but in different order.
 * For example, “Dormitory – Dirty Room”, “keep – peek”,  “School Master – The Classroom” are some anagrams.
 */

import java.util.Arrays;

/**
 * Solution:
 * First we clean the input by removing all white spaces from the given two strings
 * and change the case of all characters of both the strings to lower case so that
 * case of both input strings will be ignored. After cleaning the input strings,
 * we convert them to character array and sort them using sort() method of java.util.Arrays class.
 * After sorting, we compare both the arrays using equals() method of same Arrays class.
 * This method will return true if both arrays have same set of characters.
 * Below is the complete anagram program using sort() and equals() methods.
